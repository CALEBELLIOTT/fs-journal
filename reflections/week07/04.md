## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

This week in our partner project we made use of the pair programming principles that we learned in the first journal this week. It really helped us be more productive and I think it has some huge advantages when compared to working separately on the same project

2. What went well this week?

This week was a really good review for me with Node.js. I found myself really rusty at the beginning of the week and building the fullstack applications helped me to shake that rust off. 

3. What would you do differently?

I don't think I would do very many things differently this week. I think balancing preparing for the checkpoint mentally and refreshing my knowledge on node was a really good use of my time. I am also really proud of the way my checkpoint turned out and learned a lot in the process of building it.
