## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is writing how certain code works and how to use it. It can be done in a ReadMe, inside the file, or an external guide. 

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Code documentation can help you or others to remember how to use code that has already been written. It also allows you to use JsDoc to specify types, and data that is meant to be passed into a function. This means that you can get intellicense for these things which can be really useful when you are using previously written code. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

It is really important. Code is only as useful if it is useable. If you have an entirely functional piece of code, but you don't remember how to use it and you didn't write it down, it can be really challenging to make use of that code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We continued to work on the same project as yesterday. Once again I feel like the main takeaway from this project was shaking off the rust from the week we had off from node.
