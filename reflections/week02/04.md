## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Planning is incredibly important for the coding process and not doing it can put you into a really bad position where you will ultimately be doing more work. That is obviously not the goal. Planning an overall goal and the overarching way you are going to be attacking that goal is the best way to plan according to the article. Planning in small increments, executing, and testing is the best way to write high quality code. Overplanning can be an issue just as underplanning can be according to the article. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Using google is the best way that I have found to solve problems. Usually when I run into a problem that I haven't solved before, doing a google search using the correct keywords helps me to find exactly what I need to solve that problem. This is something that will never change as a developer. Using google and researching about new technologies is a part of the job and is something that I need to continue getting used to.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

I think that there were a lot of takeaways in the article. It touched on a lot of important parts about what it means to be a developer. There were some things that struck me as most important however. Firstly, leaving code cleaner that what you found it is a really good rule of thumb. Especially for junior developers such as ourselves (who are writing very messy code), it is easy to think that the code is too messy to try to fix. However this is not the case and you can learn a lot just from cleaning code. Another thing that struck me as really important is making sure to write lots of tests. I know from my own experience coding, it is really important to test every function of your application while you are building it. I think that this tip will be important throughout my whole career as a developer.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment was the most fun one that we have done yet! Me and my partner's strengths really complimented each other's when writing this. One thing that I found to be really fun in this project was really making sure every function that I wrote had one purpose. This project had the most functions of any assignment yet and managing all of them and making sure they were specific to a certain problem was a great learning experience.
