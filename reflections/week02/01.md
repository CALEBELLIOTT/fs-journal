## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is the area in which data is available in code. If you create a code block in a function or a conditional and you create a variable- this variable will only be available for use within that code block. You will not be able to access that variable outside of that block because the scope of that variable doesn't allow it. However, you can access variables and functions that are defined outside of a code block. You can reach out, however you can not reach in.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is when function and variable declarations are interpreted to be at the top of the code no matter where they reside. This doesn't mean that the function or variable will be defined at the beginning, but it does exist. According to the readings, if you call a variable before it is defined in the code, you will get back undefined rather than null. The variable exists in the memory, but it has yet to be defined. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let is block scoped which means that when you define or redefine a let variable within a code block, it is only available within that code block. If you call that same variable outside of the code block, it will revert back to its original value or be undefined respectively. This can be useful as you don't have to keep track of a variables value if you are manipulating it within a code block as you would have to do if you were using var. Let cannot be redefined within its scope, like var. It can be redefined outside of its scope however.

Note however that when let variables are hoisted, their keywords are not initialized so you will get a reference error if you try to use a let variable before it is defined. 

const is similar to let but it can only be accessed in the block that it was declared, and it cannot be redefined. This variable would be used for data that you don't ever want to change. Properties of const objects can be changed, but it has to be directly. You cannot redefine an entire const object.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I really enjoyed today's project! One of the biggest takeaways for me was using parameters and arguments to accomplish tasks. This was not something that I had a huge amount of experience in before today, so it was useful to learn more about how to implement those. I also challenged myself by using a library rather than just normal variables to keep track of data which was fun.
