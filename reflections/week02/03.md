## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You can write to the console in a few ways. The two that were discussed in the reading were via console.log() and console.error(). The console log is a great way to test code to ensure that it is working. I know that I use this method frequently while I am coding. The console.error method is used to log errors. This can be useful if you write functions to alert you to errors in your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab is what gives you the breakdown of HTML and CSS. This can be incredibly useful when testing styles and your HTML structure. The ability to adjust styles directly in the browser and seeing their effects without having to refresh the page is really powerful. It is something that I want to do more frequently when I am coding my own projects. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using the sources tab when coding in javascript is a really useful way to debug your code. Using the strategy of including breakpoints and iterating through your code one line at a time can be really useful to see exactly where a problem is occurring. This is something I didn't know previously to doing this journal and is something that I want to try in the future.
