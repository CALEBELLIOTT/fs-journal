## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The three ways to write a function are through function declaration, function expressions, and arrow function expressions. A function declaration is hoisted so that the function will be available for use before it is declared. A function expression defines an anonymous function and it is not hoisted. Therefore it must be used after it is defined. An arrow function expression works similarly to a function expression but its syntax is shorter. 

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters used when defining a variable. They are the keywords that you put in the quotation marks when DEFINING a variable. Arguments are the values that are passed through to the parameters when calling a function. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is a function that takes another function as one of its parameters. An example that the reading gave for this was Array.prototype.map. An example that I think could possibly be a higher order function is math.floor.random.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

In today's assignment I learned how to separate tasks among multiple functions and call those functions within the functions where that utility is needed. This prevents you from hard-coding the same thing over and over again across multiple functions and saves a lot of time and reduces the chances of errors occurring. I also attempted to implement player data into the game to track high scores, which turned out to be very challenging.
