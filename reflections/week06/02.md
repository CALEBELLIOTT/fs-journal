## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are how variables are passed from component to component. They work very similarly to passing arguments into a function that takes a parameter. 

2. What are props used for?

Props are used to access values when they need to be passed from one component to another. In class, we passed a prop when conducting a v-for in order to access the needed data when iterating over a component. 


3. Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can only be accessed if they are being passed from a parent to a child. They are also read only meaning that they cannot be edited - only the level with actual access to the value can edit it.
