## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

You can provide a route with children which allows you to increase the amount of pages in your application available to you. This could have been implimneted in today's project well to change account information through a user/:id/account route.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

Nested routes such as user/:id/profile or user/:id/posts are good examples for nested routes. 

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

You can pass parameters through nested routes. You would do this when you need to pass additional data to a route. This could be an id for a user or a post that will provide additional information to a route.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


Today's assignment was really good. I felt much more solid on the subjects that we have been learning about over the past week. One thing that we did today was make a route that took in an id to dynamically display posts rather than using a modal like in projects earlier this week. This seemed to be a much more effective way to display data than a modal.
