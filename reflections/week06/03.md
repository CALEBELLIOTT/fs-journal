## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks allow a programmer to know when something happens to a component. This may be when it is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed. It allows the programmer to also utilize these events to specify certain actions. 

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

One lifecycle hook that we have used a few times in our afternoon projects is onMount. This specific lifecycle hook will run specified code when a specific element is added to the page. It is kind of used instead of a constructor in MVC.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are the most commonly used lifecycle hooks. They allow a programmer to run specific code either right before, or right after, a component is rendered to the page.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We didn't get a chance to use those yesterday and working through problems using those today was challenging and a good learning experience.
