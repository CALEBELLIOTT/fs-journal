## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

A component based architecture is an architecture that is organized vertically rather than horizontally. This differs from the MVC architecture that we have been used to using recently. It allows you to use and reuse components which can be useful for apps that will reuse certain things throughout the UI.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

Like stated above, being able to reuse components can be extremely useful and minimize the amount of code required to accomplish a task. Using CBA the right way can also improve readability.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Applications may become bloated and hard to read if a certain component becomes too large. This is one of the main drawbacks when compared to MVC. Overuse of CBA can also lead to problems as it should be a tool to solve certain issues, not a solution to every problem.

Todays assignment was a great introduction to Vue. I found myself understanding the basics after this assignment and watching the changes take place right on the page was really useful.
