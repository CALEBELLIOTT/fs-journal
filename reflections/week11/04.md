## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have really enjoyed this course. I have learned more than I had expected going in and my depth of knowledge has increased exponentially. Despite this, I have also come to realize how much I don't know. I would say that I feel really good for learning as much as what I have, but part of me is also scared for working in a real job. I am eager to learn and continue to educate myself, even outside of work/ school, and I hope that whatever employer hires me is able to work with that.
