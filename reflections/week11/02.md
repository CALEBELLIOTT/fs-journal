## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key defines a column as a uniquely identifiable piece of data for that table. A foreign key is a uniquely identifiable piece of data that references a primary key on another table. It is used to create a relationship between the two tables. 

2. What is an `Alias`?

An Alias is an instance of a table that you can use when making join sql requests. It is basically a copy of the table that is formed when you first list it in your sql request. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
FROM
  doctors d,
  d.* as doctor
  p.* as patient
INNER JOIN doctors d On doctorId = d.id
INNER JOIN patients p On patientId = p.id


```

I took today to mainly work on all spice. I want to get this project to the point where it can be deployed and used as a portfolio piece. I also managed to get my Tower application fixed so it was deployed properly.
