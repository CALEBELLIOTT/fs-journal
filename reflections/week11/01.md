## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance can be used for a variety of things in C#. One useful thing that inheritance can provide is that it allows for a reduction in the amount of code that is rewritten by allowing derived classes to have all the data that a parent class has. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Not all members of a class are inherited. The constructor of a class isn't inherited from the base class. Each class must declare its own constructors. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Private members of a class aren't accessible to the derived classes of that class. However, if the derived class is nested within the parent class, then the private members of that parent class are available to it. Protected members are available only to the derived classes of the parent class.

Today, I worked on a combination of the daily project and finishing AllSpice. It was a great review of C# and reviewing Vue models once again was really helpful.
