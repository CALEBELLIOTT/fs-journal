## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

sql injection is when an attacker inserts sql into data that is passing through to a database. This can be really bad as they can have complete control over the database by doing this. 

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

1) putting sql into a form input whose data will be passed on to the database.
2) Modifying cookies that will be read by the server.
3) HTTP headers can be modified to have sql commands in them which can be used to stage a sql injection attack. 

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

There is software that can be used to automatically conduct and test sql injection attacks. Using this and finding vulnerabilities in your code is a good way to prevent future attacks.
