## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

The purpose of wire-framing is to plan out the UI and UX of an application or website. Additionally, it helps a company conduct research and determine if the current UI and UX direction is the one that is desired by users in a cheap way. It also gives developers a perfect template to follow when building the application.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The three different levels to a wire-frame are low-fidelity, medium-fidelity, and high-fidelity. The low fidelity wire-frame is useful as it is easily edited and is perfect for quickly testing ideas when just beginning to design an application. A medium-fidelity wire-frame is a middle ground between high and low and lays out elements more specifically than a low fidelity wire-frame but doesn't add actual content and colors as a high-fidelity wire frame may have. This is perfect for user testing and medium stage planning for a website or application. High-fidelity wire-frames are ideal for the very end of idea development. They are expensive and time consuming to produce so they are used primarily as templates for developers to use and testing with actual content that will be displayed on the page. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes! I think that wire-framing is extremely important in fact. I had a personal experience with this that I will address more below. Wire-framing allows for detailed planning, testing, and intentional design practices that would not be possible without wire-framing. This practice will most definitely save both time and money for companies in the long run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This assignment made me realize the importance of detailed planning before beginning a project. Because this project was mostly self-directed and a design wasn't selected for us, wire-framing proved to be incredibly important. I would say that me and my partner didn't spend enough time doing this before starting to code and we regretted it later on in the project.
