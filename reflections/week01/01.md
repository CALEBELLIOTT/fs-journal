## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Developers use git to handle the complexities of multiple developers working on a project at once. Git allows developers to manage changes in projects both locally and remotely. Git also allows users to branch and merge projects so that multiple developers can work on a project.



2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Having multiple branches allows developers in a project to work on development simultaneously. commits can be made separately to each branch and then branches can be merged. This allows for seamless editing on the same program when working with a team of developers. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is a local repository that exists on your personal device. GitHub is a remote repository that exists on the github servers. GitHub allows you to pull changes from other developers, or yourself from a different device, onto your current device. GitHub also allows you to clone projects that exist on the remote repository.
