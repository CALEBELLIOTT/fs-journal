## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I thought that the tip that lighter grey on a white background is great to deemphasize content because it is blending more into the background and reducing contrast. The point that changing less important text to a color closer to the background is important for colored backgrounds. Also reducing the use of borders in exchange for box shadows was an interesting point and is something I may try in the future. Having templates for standard buttons for different situations is a unique idea. Separating semantics from your layout can be beneficial for your design.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I found this site when googling well designed websites. I found that some of the UI elements were well designed. There was an email popup that used the matching the demphasized text color to the background. They also have some buttons with borders while others were merely text which I thought struck a good balance.

This site I found interesting due to the overall build of the site. I thought that they balanced simplicity and presenting information really well. I also found the use of certain animations to be really cool and eye catching. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design is a huge part of how a user interprets the purpose of a website or application. While I was browsing websites to answer question 2, I noticed that I could usually tell the purpose of the site based purely off of the design. Good design also should lead the user through the application in a really natural way.

This assignment was a really good introduction into bootstrap. I found it to be incredibly interesting and made styling a page much much easier. I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of documentation that I have to learn, but I think that it will come with time.
