## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo classes are classes in css that add styling to elements but only when certain specifications are met. The pseudo selectors that I imagine we will be using the most will include :hover, :root, and :focus.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Every CSS rule will have a specific specificity added to it. Specificity determines what style will be applied to an element when there are multiple rules that could apply. Rules with higher specificities will style an element over a lower specificity rule. You can use this to your benefit by making a lower specificity  rule that will apply to a broad amount of your page and then style more specifically using higher specificity to override the broad styling when needed.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

!important will override any other styling including inline styling. It can become a problem when you want to change the style of something that is affected by a rule tagged with !important. It will be impossible to do this, so therefore !important should be used very rarely.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment taught me a lot about using CSS. Working with flex-box turned out to be challenging for me and working with properties such as justify-content was difficult. I don't fully understand all the different display or flex modes and managing positioning content in the way that I want to is still very confusing. I'm hoping I can improve on this over the course of the next week. As we move on to working with bootstrap I want to continue to hone my css skills so I can affectively work with both default css and bootstrap.
