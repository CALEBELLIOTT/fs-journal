## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for representational state transfer. It means that when a user requests information from a RESTful API, it gets a representation of the data at a certain state. It must have uniform interface, client and server separation, be stateless, have a layered system, be chacheable, and able to be coded on demand. 

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means that the API doesn't know what previous requests the client makes. There is no storage of request history from a client and past requests do not influence future responses. 

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

When a user calls on an API, they must specify a desired endpoint using a URL. URL stands for uniform resource locator. In addition to the URL, they must also specify what HTTP method they want to use such as get, post, put, or delete.

This assignment was one of the more fun ones that we have done so far. One of the biggest takeaways from this one was using APIs that required credentials and were generally more complicated than previous APIs that we have used. Implementing the search feature in this assignment was also really interesting and challenging.
