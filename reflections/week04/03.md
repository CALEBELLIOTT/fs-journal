## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and await are built apun promises and an async function will actually simply return a promise. They were introduced to further improve syntax of promises by making code look as if it was synchronous while it actually is not. This makes it much easier to handle code you want to run asynchronously. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

all you have to do is affix the word 'await' before the promise and the code will wait for the response before continuing.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

The biggest benefit to async and await is that they allow for much simpler syntax and better readability than promises. They also allow for much easier debugging.

Today's assignment was the first time that we have pulled data from one API and added it to another. This presented some unique challenges that were great to work through. Manipulating the data so that it fit the correct formatting for the API we were adding it to was a great learning experience.
