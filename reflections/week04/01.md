> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

According to the article, callback hell occurs when a programmer writes code as if it was running from top to bottom. While this is usually the case, JS allows us to run code asynchronously to solve this issue. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means that specified code will wait for certain processes to run before continuing. This is really useful as you can tell your code to wait when doing something like gathering data from APIs. Callbacks are used to specify what the next task is after a certain process runs. 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

the first way is to keep your code shallow. This means to separate different tasks into different functions and call these functions rather than hard coding in the processes. The second way is to modularize. This means building out libraries whenever possible. The third way is to deal with every single error. Unhandled errors can cascade through your whole application and cause many different problems.

Today's assignment was a really good introduction to async and accessing APIs. One problem that I ran into that was good to learn how to handle was handling api data when it is different than the datatype classes that you made. It is important to analyze the data coming in from the api before building out your application to make sure that you are using data that actually exists.
