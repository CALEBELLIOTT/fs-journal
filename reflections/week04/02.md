## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three stages to a promise are pending (when the promise is waiting for a response), rejected (when the promise fails), and resolved (when the promise is completed).

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

promises can 'chain' which allows you to avoid callback hell. When using callbacks, you have to passthrough one function to another, however when chaining with promises, all you have to do is use 'then' to attach a callback. This can make a series of callbacks look much cleaner and be much more readable.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() specifies what is to be done after a promise is completed. .catch() specifies what is to be done in the case that a promise is rejected.
