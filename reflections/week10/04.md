## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An Enum is a type of data created when you assign a string to a numerical value. You can use this to set options for a datatype. You also use enums for message boxes when using .net.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify the base type of an enum in C#. This could be useful in C# as it is a strongly typed language. You can also change the member values of enums. This can be useful to repurpose an enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used enums yet. However I think that using one to make limit on options for a model would be a common use for an enum.

Today we started our all spice project. Coding out a fullstack application with C# as the backend has been daunting but also fun and rewarding.
