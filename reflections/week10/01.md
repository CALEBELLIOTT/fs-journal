## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, reference type, pointer type. A value type holds its value in its own memory space. A reference type contains instructions to find the location of where the data is stored. A pointer is a data type whose value is the location of another variable.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

There are many value type data types in C#. Some of these are long, int, decimal, and ulong. These value types differ from the JS value types as there are much more of them. In JS the only number data type was number. However C# has many more datatypes for this category which are all stored differently in memory.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference values are stored as instructions to where the actual values of the data are located. Value types don't include this. The value datatype is the actual data which is directly stored.

Today was a good introduction into C#. I was able to get to understand some of the syntax by the end of this project. Noticing the similarities and differences between C# and JS was interesting.
