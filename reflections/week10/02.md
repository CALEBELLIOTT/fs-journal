## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is similar to an array in JS. Arrays in C# are different because they are a fixed length and aren't as useful as arrays are in JS. Lists lengths are not fixed and therefore have much more utility than a C# array.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I think the list methods that I will end up using the most will be foreach, insert, remove, and contains. I think that these will be the most useful for manipulating data within lists.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You could use [] to target an item at a specific index. For example List[1] would get the list item at index 1.

Today was a great learning experience while working on the daily project. I started to understand the pattern of building C# servers. Using a typed language actually has turned out to be really interesting and useful.
