## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

For our capstone project, we used the typical technologies that we have used previously including vue, node.js, mongoose, and auth0. The new technologies that we implemented were the Google Maps autocomplete API, mapbox integration, and google maps geolocating. 

2. What went well so far?

The teamwork in our team was really good. Communication between all of us was really strong and I think that lead us to get a lot of work done efficiently.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

One thing that I would do differently next time is to spend more time fleshing out the idea before beginning to build the project. I found that we had to make both design and feature decisions after we had already begun building which lead to some inefficiencies.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today we got a lot of work done on the project details page. It is beginning to look a lot more like the mock which is great and a lot of the features are coming together nicely.
