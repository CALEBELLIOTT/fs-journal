## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

A base64 encoded image is an image that represents binary information in a text format. This can be useful when you cannot use actual binary to encode something, such as in HTML or CSS.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Base64 encoding increases the file size of images by about 25%. It can also hurt your SEO and images that encoded this way cannot be shared or downloaded by users. It can also be strenuous on your CPU as calculations are required to decode the encoded base64 strings. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

With the introduction of HTTP 2, there is much more data that can be passed through a single connection than before. Because Base64 encoding was used to bypass the limits of these connections originally, the base 64 encoding strategy has become much less useful than before.

Today was more work on mapbox. We successfully got mapbox to display on our app and display locations with our custom pins. This was a huge undertaking and I was really proud of the outcome.
