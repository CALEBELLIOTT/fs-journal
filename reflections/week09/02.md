## Questions

A github action is instructions that you can give github to do when a certain event occurs. This is done through "workflows" which are specified in YAML files. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Github actions allow you to automate certain processes, like building or merging branches. You can also be sent personalized messages when someone makes a merge request or when someone stars a repository. 

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Workflow, Scheduled, Webhooks, and external events can all trigger a workflow. These events will trigger changes that can include pushing, merging, or forking.
