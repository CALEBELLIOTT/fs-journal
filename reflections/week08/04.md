## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing - Allows a developer to test units of code in isolation. This can be useful when testing a small subset of code.

End-to-end Testing - End to end testing tests the user experience of an app by testing both the front end and the back end and everything in between.

Component Testing - Used to test vue components. Useful since usually vue components need to be attached to the DOM in order to be tested.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think end to end testing is most likely the most useful type of testing. While it isn't specific, you can find out if there is an issue in the front end, back end, or with a way the two interact. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I don't think any of these tests not be considered useful. They all have their place and time. However, I think that component testing would most likely be the least utilized test.
