## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Testing is when you write tests that call specific methods to ensure their functionality. This can allow programmers to not launch their application every time they want to test a feature.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

One benefit is not having to launch your application every time you want to test it. This can save a lot of time, especially when you have to navigate through pages or fill out input fields to test something. Another benefit is that tests speak louder than comments and rather than commenting your code, writing tests can be much better. Test results will change as your code changes, while comments will not. 

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

Writing unit tests can be potentially time consuming. This can become a problem if a project has a tight deadline. Although the time spent debugging can be lessened greatly when unit tests are used properly, so this may even out in the long run.
