## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication on a small team is important because all stakeholders (internal and external) being up to date on the progress of a project is extremely important. Ongoing communication increases productivity, effective teamwork, and quality of projects. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

More frequent communication may be required as each team will have more tasks assigned than in larger teams. Consistent messaging via slack may be a good alteration to make to the SCRUM methodology that may make the development process more efficient in smaller groups. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle consists of quality, speed, and cost. To have two, you cannot have the third. For example, a cheap application that is quality won't be fast. A fast application that is high quality will be expensive. A cheap application that is fast won't be quality.
