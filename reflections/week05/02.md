## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The different types of relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many. These describe the relationship possibilities between different pieces of data.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking allows you to allocate more space to comments when they aren't embedded directly in with the blog post. This means that you will be much less likely to hit the 16 MB maximum document size. The application will also have a much easier time sorting the comments into chunks. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

One factor to consider when setting up a many to many relationship is how much each datatype is going to be edited. One datatype in the relationship may be very unlikely to be changed while the other once changes on a regular basis. In this case, embedding data within the datatype that isn't as likely to change is a good idea.

Today was a good introduction into accessing and using databases. We took what we learned yesterday and added a MongoDB server. We also got an introduction into permissions with auth0 which seems like it will be a big part of development going forward.
