## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time boxing is setting aside a specific amount of time to every task that you have planned out. It is designed to allow you to be more organized in your tasks and limits the amount of time spent on each one.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

The first strategy I am going to implement is to "ruthlessly apply strategic quitting". By doing this, you are able to focus on the thing that is most productive, which allows you to get more done, save more time, and make more money. The second strategy I am going to implement is to contain tasks that I expect to only take a couple minutes, to a 2 minute time window. It's really easy to get caught up in the details that don't really matter in small projects. Limiting this will save a lot of time. The third strategy I am going to use is to practice. Getting good at timbering (like everything else) requires practice. Doing it consistently will help me to get better at it.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

One time that I definitely could have benefitted from time boxing was back in college. I was writing an email to my professor about an assignment and I realized that I had spent 20 minutes on the email and was overthinking every single sentence. When he finally responded his email contained a single sentence - "ok, sounds good.". I obviously had spent too much of my time on that email and would have greatly benefitted from spending less time on it.

This was a great implimentation to creating apis for a project we are already familiar with. It was nice to apply it to something that we already knew as it allowed me to understand the things we were creating better.
