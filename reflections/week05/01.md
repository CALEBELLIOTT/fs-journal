## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

The purpose of a query string is to help you find specific data within an API. You can search using key value pairs to get to a targeted section in an API. 

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter starts with a question mark (?). You search using key value pairs in the following syntax: name=mark. You can string together multiple parameters using the & symbol: name=mark&age=34.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters will help you access data that would otherwise be hard to find. This will be especially useful as databases get bigger and bigger as sorting through large amounts of data can be challenging.

Todays assignment was a really good introduction to creating APIs and accessing them through crud methods. This was a good practice for getting used to the syntax of all of these functions.
