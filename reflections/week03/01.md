## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

using exports solves the problem of certain code only being available in one file when using multiple js files in one document. exporting necessary pieces of code from one file to another solves this issue. 

2. How does export differ from export default?

export differs from default export in a few ways. Named exports allow you to have multiple exports on the same file while default exports are only allowed once on the same file. You are also able to refer to a named export's name when referencing it in other files. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

One benefit to using the module system is that it keeps your files much cleaner. Once appications begin to grow, creating and maintaining clean code becomes more and more challenging. Using the module system helps to eliminate the complexities that come with this by spreading out functionality between many files.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This assignment was extremely challenging for me. Understanding MVCS and the roles of all of the different file types was really confusing at times. This was our first time working with many things such as js classes, imports, exports, and the MVCS file structure. Juggling these things made creating this simple project more challenging than it would have been previously but it did help me to understand these concepts more which is important as these concepts will remain present.
