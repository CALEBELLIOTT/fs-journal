> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern is used to solve a developer desiring to update the document in response to certain events. The observer pattern will watch for these events and automatically run code when these events are detected. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast. Subscribe adds a new event and adds it to a list of observed events. Unsubscribe will remove events from the array of observed events. Broadcast will iterate through the array of observed events and execute. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The event emitter within the BCW template works by watching for certain events to occur. In this case, it is looking for targeted data to be set to something new. Once this is detected, it will run a specified function. It starts by checking whether or not the data exists and whether or not it is passed a function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This assignment helped me to realize the importance of planning out your application and data structure before diving into it. We would have had a much easier time if we had started out with both a list and task datatype rather than just using a list datatype. Thinking about the possibility of running into issues before starting to flesh out a project is a really great idea.
