## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get and Set are the two most common operations that we will use. Get returns the value of an object's property, while set will set the value.


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

In order to make sure that the value doesn't get set to undefined, you have to pass in the object and property being accessed as parameters. If you don't do this, then the value of the object will be set to undefined. 

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Our proxy objects have traps which doesn't allow the value of the arrays to be set to anything but their class objects. This is useful for us as it prevents us from mixing data types in our arrays.
