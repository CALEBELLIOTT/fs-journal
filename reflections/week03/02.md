## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is used to contain methods and functions which affect certain data, only within the scope of that data. This allows for better organized code and lessens the likelyhood of errors occurring.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The underscore prefix can be problematic as it is easily ignored. Developers who aren't aware of the convention, or developers who choose to ignore it, may use a function that is only meant to be used within the context of a different method or function. This can lead to errors that could have otherwise been avoided.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You create private variables in a ES6 class by using a # prefix on the variable. This can also be attached to methods.

Today's assignment went a lot smoother than yesterday's assignment. The work I put in yesterday to understand today's content paid off and I was able to complete it without a hitch. Todays assignment helped to solidify the concepts that we learned for the first time yesterday and I actually felt like I had an understanding today.
