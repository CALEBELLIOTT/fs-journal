# Advanced Front-End Frameworks


**1.** Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

you can bind data in element attributes by putting a colon before the attribute. You can data bind in the body of an html tag by using the double curly brackets ({{}})

```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?

SPA stands for single page applications

```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

SPAs are generally quicker and more responsive than MPAs. They are also considered to be more modern. SPAs are great for smaller applications as the benefits of MPAs are most useful in large applications.

```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

the onMounted method will take specified actions when a component or page is rendered to the screen

```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

v-model is an attribute that will take data from a page and model it to data within the script section of your vue file. If one side of this model changes, the other side will change as well.

```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?

**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?

It specifies a piece of data on each iteration of a v-for that will be unique. It is used to keep track of the v-for looping process.

```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?

a slot is used to inject data into a component. This makes components more reusable and helps you to prevent rewriting code for components that are only marginally different from one another.
